# Formal Quantum Algorithm Methodology (FQAM)

A methodology for formally deriving quantum algorithms. Inspired by FLA. 

Currently being worked on. The goal is to provide a framework to think visually about quantum algorithms in terms of the configuration space as opposed to the gate model. The conventional gate model for quantum computing is obtuse and unintuitive. It is much easier to conceptualize a quantum algorithm in terms of its behavior in state space configuration, observing how the program state changes and evolves over time.
